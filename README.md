# Project Description

This project was a combined effort with Cerner, a U.S supplier of healthcare information technology solutions. With a mission to seek innovations that will help shape healthcare and empower their clients, Cerner works to surface data that enables informed decisions to arm clinicians with the information they need to provide smarter care. At the start of this project, our main goal was to define the minimum required features that a patient portal must have for it to be able to be used as a portal. The first ten weeks of our project explored this: the main features patients use in their portals, and how those features might fall short of user expectations. In the process of defining our MVP, our team located a new and exciting user group that gave us the opportunity to pivot from redesigning the MVP screens of a patient portal to improving the experience for a specific group of users. After much discussion with our sponsor team, we decided to embrace this new problem space. Our final deliverables were presented to our sponsors in form of a final presentation and documentation.

User Group
As explained above, our second goal enabled us to design for a unique user group. During our process to satisfy our first goal of defining our MVP research persona, we found a user group that had a huge potential to have a better experience using portals. This user group is:

# Parents of young children with frequent pop-up health issues.

Final Goal
With our user group decided, we added a final goal for our project: to improve the overall experience of using a patient portal for parents of young kids, who experience “pop-up” medical issues. But how do we define a “better” experience for our users? Our project & final solution explores ways to minimize stress and caregiver burden by making the portal streamlined, personalized, and simple.

# "Minimize the effort required to use a patient portal"
